In SwiftUI, the term "StickyHeader" typically refers to a custom implementation or a third-party library used to create a sticky header behavior in a scrollable view. A sticky header is a UI element, often a header or a navigation bar, that remains fixed at the top of the screen as the content is scrolled beneath it.

To achieve a sticky header effect in SwiftUI, you would typically combine different SwiftUI components and techniques. This may involve using a ScrollView or List to display the scrollable content and a combination of GeometryReader and ScrollViewReader to track the scroll position and update the header's position accordingly.

By using the GeometryReader to get the coordinates of the header view and the ScrollViewReader to track the scroll position, you can adjust the position of the header based on the scroll offset. As the user scrolls, the header can stay fixed at the top until the next header is reached.

There are also third-party libraries available that provide ready-made solutions for sticky headers in SwiftUI. These libraries often offer additional customization options, such as different header styles, animations, or effects.

It's worth noting that since SwiftUI is a declarative framework, the implementation of a sticky header may vary depending on the specific requirements and the approach chosen by the developer or the library being used.
